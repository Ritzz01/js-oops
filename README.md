OOPs in JavaScript
This project provides an overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript, including examples and explanations. It demonstrates various OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism using practical code snippets.

Key Concepts Covered
Classes and Objects: Introduction to creating classes, constructors, and objects in JavaScript.
Static Properties and Methods: How to define and use static properties and methods.
Inheritance: Demonstrates how classes can inherit from other classes.
Function Constructors: Example of using function constructors for object creation.
Prototypes: Overview of prototype inheritance and prototype chain.
Encapsulation: Demonstrates use of getters and setters for encapsulation.
Polymorphism: Illustrates method overriding in inheritance.
Factory Method: Example of factory pattern to create objects.
Abstraction: Abstract methods and polymorphism examples.
Memory Management: Demonstrates abandoned objects and memory handling.
